## Current Focus

Building a portfolio of 6-8 production-ready projects in:
- Energy demand forecasting
- Climate risk analysis
- Atmospheric data pipelines
- Real-time weather analytics

Target: Remote data science position ($80-120K USD) with US/Canadian remote-first companies, EU remote roles, or Australian climate/energy sector positions.

## Differentiating Factors

**Science and Engineering Integration**: Unlike pure software engineers, I understand the underlying physics and can translate complex scientific problems into actionable data products.

**Production-Ready Development**: All projects are deployed, documented, and built with real-world use cases in mind, not academic exercises.

**Proven Remote Capability**: 5 years of successful remote work demonstrates self-direction, proactive communication, and consistent delivery.

**Multi-Stakeholder Design**: Projects are designed for agricultural planners, energy managers, climate researchers, and business decision-makers, not just data scientists.
