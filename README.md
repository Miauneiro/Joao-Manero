## Active Development

Currently expanding portfolio with focus on:
- Time series forecasting for energy and climate applications
- Real-time atmospheric data processing pipelines
- Production ML systems optimized for resource-constrained environments
- Business intelligence tools for climate risk assessment

Seeking remote data science opportunities where I can apply deep learning and scientific computing to solve high-impact problems in energy, climate, or environmental sectors.

Target: Remote data science position ($80-120K USD) with US/Canadian remote-first companies, EU remote roles, or Australian climate/energy sector positions.

## Why I'm Different

**Science-Engineering Integration**  
A physics degree provides a deep understanding of atmospheric processes and thermodynamics. I don't just process weather data - I understand why systems behave the way they do, enabling better feature engineering and model design. This allows me to translate complex scientific problems into actionable data products that non-technical stakeholders can use.

**Production-First Development**  
All projects are deployed with real stakeholder needs in mind:
- Energy traders need sub-3% error for profitable trading → delivered 2.5% MAPE
- Aviation planners need multiple aircraft risk profiles → built a categorical assessment system
- Climate researchers need reproducible analysis → provided documented scientific methods
- Grid operators need role-based recommendations → designed business context decision support

**8+ Years Remote Excellence**  
- 5 years private tutoring: Self-managed schedules, proactive communication with students globally
- 3 years editorial management: Async coordination across 5+ international time zones
- Current: 8 hours daily dedicated to structured skill development and project delivery
- Demonstrated ability to deliver consistently without direct supervision

**Results Over Credentials**  
Built 4 production applications while completing a degree. Proven ability to ship high-quality data products, not just study theory. Every project serves real users and solves actual business problems.
